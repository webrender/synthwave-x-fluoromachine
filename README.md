# README

This is my fork of the [Synthwave x Fluoromachine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webrender.synthwave-x-fluoromachine) theme, tweaked for higher contrast and screen share legibility.

I'm mainly using it for Rust and C and have tweaked it for personal used, but am happy to hear about any feedback!

## This is the README for your extension "lotterleben-synthwave-x-fluoromachine"
